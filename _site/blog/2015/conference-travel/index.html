								<p>Attending conferences is one of the best aspects of academic life! The great news is that (at least for now), I do have funds to send students to conferences to present their work. That said, the pot of money is limited – where you can save money, please try to, as it helps me to send you more frequently to conferences.</p>

<h2 id="risk-management">Risk Management</h2>
<p>You need to tell the university you are going on a trip. This is a quick form fill, but is important for insurance purposes (and they can also help you out if you get in a jam): <a href="https://iac01.ucalgary.ca/RiskMgmt/">https://iac01.ucalgary.ca/RiskMgmt/</a></p>

<h2 id="what-is-covered">What is covered</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Conference registration (if the ACM registration + conference registration is cheaper, then I can cover your ACM registration, too)</li>
  <li>Economy fare from Calgary to destination and back, taxi to and from airport to hotel</li>
  <li>Accommodations (normally, yours based on double occupancy); my recommendation is to try to “rent a house” if there is a large group attending a conference (i.e. through <a href="http://airbnb.com/">http://airbnb.com/</a> or <a href="http://vrbo.com">http://vrbo.com</a>).</li>
  <li>Meals (within reason)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You <em>must</em> keep all of your receipts – this means both your credit card slips, as well as the itemized receipt. Do not forget this; otherwise, it is difficult to reimburse you. Please ensure that when you go to a restaurant as a group that you ask for a separate receipt (it is usually easiest to do this at the outset).</p>

<h2 id="what-i-do-not-cover">What I do not cover</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Any alcohol (make sure it does not appear on your receipts!)</li>
  <li>Incidentals</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="procedure-to-get-reimbursed">Procedure to get reimbursed</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Keep all of your receipts (ordered by date). Make sure that you have the itemized receipt (this is the most important). You can include your credit card slip (say for tips). I normally keep all this in an envelope.</li>
  <li>When you get back to school, fill out the <a href="/assets/files/conference-expense-claim-worksheet.xlsx">conference expense claim worksheet</a> with your receipts date-ordered from oldest to newest.</li>
  <li>Scan each of your receipts (you can use Claudia’s scanner)</li>
  <li>Print out the worksheet, staple your receipts to the back.</li>
  <li>Take a look at the <a href="http://grouplab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Main.ExpensingDetails">Ilab Wiki Expensing Details</a> for more information, before asking Claudia for further details.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="help-tony-by-getting-travel-grants">Help Tony by Getting Travel Grants</h2>
<p>The university hands out a lot of awards to students that are traveling to present at conferences. If you have a poster, paper, or workshop paper accepted, you qualify for these. Please apply for these in this case, as it helps the group as a whole.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Student Activities Fund is available to both undergrads and graduate students, but it only happens twice a year. Apply for the <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/leadership/programs/saf">SAF here</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are doing Health and Wellness research (or something close to it), apply for the <a href="http://www.ucalgary.ca/usrp/about/travel_award">Graeme Bell USRP Travel Award</a>.</li>
  <li>If you are a graduate student, apply for the Faculty of Graduate Studies Travel Awards – note that awards for Canadian &amp; PR are different than for International students: <a href="https://grad.ucalgary.ca/awards/opportunities/university_awards">1</a> <a href="https://iac01.ucalgary.ca/FGSA/Public/SpecificAward.aspx?AwardID=3269">2</a></li>
  <li>If you are an undergraduate student, apply for the <a href="http://www.su.ucalgary.ca/page/quality-education/finance-and-awards/travel-and-conference-funding">SU Travel and Conference Fund</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="some-tips">Some Tips</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Vacation.</strong> Students often take time to vacation/travel on either end of the trip. This is normally okay with me, though please confirm. One cool thing is that I can reimburse you for the cost of the trip from YYC-(destination) and back. That means if you do something like this: YYC-(destination)-(somewhere else)-YYC, I can still pay for the part that I normally would have paid for. All you need to do is get a same-day quote for how much it would have been for a YYC-(destination) roundtrip.</li>
  <li><strong>Accommodations.</strong> Normally, I will pay for the nights of the conference + at least one night on either end (i.e. get there the day before the conference).</li>
  <li><strong>Student Volunteering.</strong> Many conferences are run through the help of student volunteers. If you can, you should try to get in on this for a few reasons, as you get all or some of: (a) free registration, (b) free meals, (c) closer contact with many of the “stars”, (d) cheaper accommodations, and (e) an automatic set of “friends”. I can’t emphasize (e) enough – many conferences are large and overwhelming; the SV experience gives you a set of peers (other undergrad and graduate students) to hang out with. I had a great time as an SV, and still remain good friends with people I met during that time. Most SIGCHI conferences are run through this site: <a href="http://chisv.org/">http://chisv.org/</a>, where you can sign up for the lottery. Other conferences will have other procedures.</li>
