RICELab is a sub-lab of the larger [Interactions Lab](http://ilab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca) group, where we are collocated with several other groups interested in HCI, InfoVis, HRI and Design. We are all part of the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/) in the [University of Calgary](http://www.ucalgary.ca/) located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada.

Interactions Lab is in Math Sciences 680 (MS680) at the University of Calgary.
