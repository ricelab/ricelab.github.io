RICELab (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) designs, builds, and studies novel systems for communication and collaboration. We are comprised of faculty, students and researchers interested in studying problems in User Experience Design, Human-Computer Interaction, Computer Supported Cooperative Work, and Ubiquitous Computing. 

Our work focuses on the design, implementation and evaluation of novel interactive technologies in a variety of contexts, and involves primarily three major types of activities: the investigation of domain-specific communication and interaction problems that have implications for new (or existing) technology; the implementation of new technologies to address needs in those domain-specific contexts, and user evaluation of interactive technologies. These major activities cut across three theme areas:

* **Digital workrooms.** New technologies for collaborative activities for next generation meeting rooms, which will be comprised of large-scale interactive surfaces (walls and tables), and personal devices (tablets, mobile phones, etc.).
* **Mixed reality for collaboration.** We explore how mixed reality interfaces (AR/VR) can allow people to communicate and share knowledge across distance and time.
* **Electronic fashion.** We explore the design of new technologies that enable electronic fashion, and study how electronic fashion can be used for new forms of expressive communication. 

We are part of the [Faculty of Information](http://ischool.utoronto.ca/) in the [University of Toronto](http://www.utoronto.ca/) located in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.
