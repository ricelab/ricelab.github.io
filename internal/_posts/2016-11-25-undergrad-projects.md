**HoloLens Elicitation Study.** One of the challenges with the HoloLens is that the space of gestural interaction is still quite limited. We are interested in understanding the kinds of gestures people need and would want when interacting with 3D data. This project is mainly about designing and executing an elicitation study, and then analyzing the data from that study. It will involve playing with the Microsoft HoloLens.

**360 Video Viewing Interfaces.** 360 video gives us new ways to explore remote spaces and environments. I am interested in new interfaces that allow us to explore these spherical videos with higher speed. One idea, for instance, is to use WASD, where W and S are mapped to forward and backwards in time. This project will involve some coding (not sure what language), and interaction with novel 360 video capture devices.

**Wristwatch Interaction.** Smart watches have a limited range of interaction possibility. This seems strange given how much we use our hands in everyday life. I'm interested here in exploring how we can use machine learning on sensor data from the wristwatch's IMU sensor and microphone to capture simple counting gestures, etc. as a way to interact with the smart watch. This project is challenging, and ideal for a student who enjoys tinkering with things (and failing often). This is best suited for a student who has an interest in AI/machine learning (or background in it).

**GoodReads Visualization Tool.** GoodReads is the "Facebook of Books". The social media site exposes an API that allows us to delve into the reading behaviours and patterns of people. We are interested here in designing and evaluating interactive visualization tools that allow us to explore people's reading habits (both individually and collectively). This project will mainly involve visual design, and coding against a web API. (in collaboration with Karen Bourrier and Edith Law)

Technologies / Project Areas that I'm also interested in:
* Google's Project Tango
* Video chat
* Augmented reality Technologies
