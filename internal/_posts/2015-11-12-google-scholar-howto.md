Google Scholar is a very powerful tool for handling and finding papers related to your area of interest. I recommend it, as its searching and citation engine seems to work better (and certainly faster) than even ACM's digital library portal.

The really great thing about Google Scholar is that it is set up to work 'with' the University of Calgary, so articles that you would be able to access on campus can be made to be accessible to you 'from home' with only a few setup steps.

## Short Version
1. Sign into your Google account
1. Under "More", hit "Settings"
1. Click "Library links"
1. Type in "University of Calgary", and check off "University of Calgary - FindIT @ the UofC"
1. Click "Save"
1. Search, find and rejoice (click "FindIT @ the UofC" for full text awesomeness) - you will need to login with your UCID

## Long Version
1. Sign into your Google account
