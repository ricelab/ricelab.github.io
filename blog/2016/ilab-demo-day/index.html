								<p>Demo day is the one day of the year that Ilab is “on display” for the world to see. This is an important day for the lab, and is mandatory for all Ilab inhabitants save for extreme circumstances. It is an important day for the following external reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Funders &amp; prospective funders come.</strong> People who fund the lab through donations of equipment, money, and time are typically invited. They are the people that provide the funds that allows us to give you (the students) the space that you have. (Also, they are paying for the food you will be eating.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Collaborators &amp; prospective collaborators come.</strong> We typically invite people who we are collaborating with (and people we would like to collaborate with) to the demo day. This gives us a chance to show them all the things that we are doing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Impress the higher ups.</strong> We are one of the crown jewels of the university, and this is our opportunity to show off – not only to the university higher ups in the administration, but also to whomever they choose to invite to come see the lab.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is also an important day for the following internal reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It (mostly) consolidates demos.</strong> Doing one big demo day allows us to economize on the number of times we need to ask you to demo. Each time, it is onerous, so doing a good job once to many people allows us to not have to do it year round.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>It gives you an opportunity to talk about your work.</strong> I am a big proponent of practicing elevator pitches, because it: (a) forces you to think about how to be concise and clear when describing your work, and (b) it gives you an opportunity to get feedback on your communication skills. In a demo day context, you get to practice multiple times, and typically, you will get some interested parties lingering afterwards to talk to you about your work.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>We get to show off to one another.</strong> For newer Ilab members, Demo Day is really important, because it allows you to see what other people are doing – gives you a quick sense of the research space that Ilab covers (it is vast).</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The rest of this document outlines: (1) what demo day looks like as a visitor; (2) tasks of ilab members on demo day, and (3) major roles.</p>

<h1 id="demo-day-as-a-visitor">Demo Day as a Visitor</h1>

<p>As an outsider, demo day is very, very hectic. It feels (probably) like barely controlled chaos, but I walk away invigorated by the experience – it is great to see all the students, the student projects, and energy from a vibrant lab like Ilab.</p>

<p>It begins by stumbling out of the elevator (if I am lucky). I don’t know where I am, and I don’t know where to go.</p>

<p>I get to a big set of doors where I see a bunch of people mingling. It seems likely this is the place. I hang my coat up, and get a nametag. I then get some coffee and start mingling. Lots of students here, and a few profs, clearly.</p>

<p>I sit down when I am told to in the front area. There are a bunch of chairs lined up facing a large display. Everyone looks nervous and excited. First, the profs talk a bit about what they do. Boooring. Oh! Now, it is the students. Holy cow they are going fast. They only have a minute to talk each!? Wow, I can’t remember everything, but dang! These kids have energy. This is great!</p>

<p>Okay, now I’m in a tour group. Oh, there are four tour groups! I’m following a student around as she takes me and my group of six around to different demos. Between each of these demos, it takes about a minute to walk between. Each of these demos lasts about five minutes, and there’s barely enough time for questions before I’m whisked away to another demo! I sure am glad that my tour guide makes sure we are on time, and cuts off my group’s questions (after the allotted time) – this allows us to stay on time.</p>

<p>Demos are over. Lunch time. Wow. That was fast. I’m tired, and that was exhausting. Oh, this is great. Now I can talk to the students again about their projects. I had so many questions to ask! Now I get a chance to.</p>

<h1 id="demo-day-roles-and-tasks">Demo Day Roles and Tasks</h1>

<p>Even though the profs are technically the “hosts” of Demo Day, it really is a student event – that is, it is (mostly) student work, and it is the students that are doing most of the talking with the visitors. The profs, you will find, wander in and out of tour groups to provide additional explanation and to talk with visitors on a one-to-one basis.</p>

<p>This section is a bit messy to write, but I’ll do it in chronological order (mainly in terms of tasks):</p>

<h2 id="day-before">Day Before</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clean up the lab.</strong> This mainly means (at least) your desk. Make it tidy, make sure you have a clearly displayed name tag, and throw away the trash on your desk. Once you are done, take it upon yourself to take on one other responsibility to tidy up (e.g. take out the trash or recycling, tidy up a shared area, or helping to set up the shared demo space, etc.).</li>
  <li><strong>Set up the minute madness space.</strong> We usually do this in the lunch area in the following way: the “front” is the wall that leads to the workshop – here, we put a large display that everyone will face; facing the large display, we set up rows of chairs (usually around 4 rows of chairs – probably about 6-8 chairs per row – whatever will fit).</li>
  <li><strong>Set up the war room.</strong> The chairs are moved to a corner, and the rectangular tables are moved to line the edge of the room. The round lunch tables are usually set in the middle of the war room for the snacks and goodies.</li>
  <li><strong>Make nametags.</strong> (optional) We often make nametags for both students and visitors. If tour groups are already known, then identify this information on the nametag. Lay these out in a neat, organized way on one of the tables inside of the war room.</li>
  <li><strong>Order food.</strong> (optional) Depending on what food is being ordered, this sometimes needs a day lead time to organize pickup/drop off, etc. Decide who is picking up coffee for next day.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="day-of-demo-day">Day of Demo Day</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick up and setup coffee.</strong> Probably not optional.</li>
  <li><strong>Elevator ushers.</strong> Usually at least two students stand near elevators to help people get to the lab (e.g. one downstairs, one upstairs). This is better than signs.</li>
  <li><strong>Mad minute presentations.</strong> Make sure your mad minute is practiced. When it comes time to do mad minutes, make sure to line up behind the person who is giving the mad minute before you. Remember that your mad minute is short.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo presenters.</strong> Make sure your demo works. Once you are sure it works, please mingle with our visitors!</li>
  <li><strong>Tours.</strong> If you are a tour group leader, you have three major tasks: (1) lead your tour group between stations; (2) introduce the demo presenter, and (3) make sure to stay on the schedule – cut off answers/questions if you are running over time (this is important! – a nice way to do it is, “I’m afraid we need to move on, but [student X] will be around afterwards to answer more questions.”)</li>
  <li><strong>Food/eating setup.</strong> If you did a mad minute but are not a tour guide (and not demo’ing), then make sure to help set up food, plates, cutlery, etc. as appropriate.</li>
  <li><strong>Clean-up.</strong> Once the visitors leave, please help with the take down – this means cleaning up the food areas; war room, and the presentation space.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="major-organizational-tasks">Major Organizational Tasks</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Demo and Madness Organization
    <ul>
      <li>Demos: figure out who is demoing, where they are demoing and get a title for the demo. Put this into a spreadsheet</li>
      <li>Madness: figure out who is doing madness, and create a google doc presentation (one slide per person) that students will fill out themselves</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tour group organization.
    <ul>
      <li>Determine tour groups (size and composition). Figure out which visitors will be in which groups, and who the tour group leader will be. Tour group leader should be a student doing a mad minute. Communicate to tour group leader in advance that s/he is a tour group leader. (optional) Once this is done, mark up the nametags appropriately.</li>
      <li>Determine rotation of tour groups. Flow through the lab is challenging and difficult. Minimize conflicting flows; use the hallway where appropriate and necessary.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
