Most of the research that happens in the RICELab is funded by the Canadian public through various grants. Thus, our research belongs to the Canadian public. The posts on this blog will typically refer to the research that happens in RICELab — frequently to provide insight into the ideas underlying various research projects or papers. I hope that others can learn from our work when it is presented this form, particularly because we are not required to use “academicisms” and be terse with the language here.

You are encouraged to ask questions through the blog, and we will try to provide a timely response when possible.
