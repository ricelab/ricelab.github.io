I am currently loving [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). I've been using Markdown as my primary writing "language" within [SublimeText](https://www.sublimetext.com/), and [loving every minute of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRVUe2Ha6dg). It wasn't until recently that I found some time to really tinker with my SublimeText configuration, and so I've gotten a chance to try out probably around two dozen plugins for SublimeText all in an effort to ~~procrastinate~~ improve my efficiency. The fact that the plugin system allows for composable efficiency is one of the hugest wins here -- it essentially lets me create my own vi/vim/emacs/whatever-the-hell while allowing me to go back to my Notepad/pico roots when I don't feel like being a keyboard whiz.

One of the most fun things to do was to construct a paper submission draft without opening up Word until we basically had the whole draft together. To do this, we used [mdwiki](http://www.mdwiki.info/) to preview while we all (I think) wrote in SublimeText, sharing through Dropbox.

While we were poking around, I did discover [markdeep](http://casual-effects.com/markdeep/), which looks like a pretty nice combination of writing+previewing in place. I also discovered [PubCSS](http://thomaspark.co/2015/01/pubcss-formatting-academic-publications-in-html-css/) around that time, which made me fantasize a bit about a tool to automagically convert from markdown to HTML and then into this pretty format... and then it was time to review another draft...

Aside: as I was writing this, out of nostalgia, I tried to find my "ex" favourite text editor, and I was very surprised to see that [EditPlus](https://www.editplus.com) somehow made it out of the Windows XP years just fine. The last update was in July of this year! I'm blown away.
