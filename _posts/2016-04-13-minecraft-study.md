The University of Calgary Conjoint Faculties Research Ethics Board has approved this research study.

## Purpose

As computer scientists, we are interested in how to design more effective tools to enable people to work together. The purpose of this study is to understand the kinds of challenges people face when engaged in group builds in Minecraft. By understanding the problem solving activities of teams, the kinds of processes they enact to address these challenges, and the workarounds they have employed, we believe that we can learn how to design better tools -- both within the context of Minecraft, and other 3D modeling tools.

## What you will be asked to do

If you agree to participate, you will be involved in an interview (likely by Skype) about your group build activities in Minecraft. There will be four sets of questions: (a) first, about the kinds of group builds you have been involved in; (b) second, the kinds of challenges you have encountered in group builds; (c) the kinds of process you have used to solve the challenges, and (d) the kinds of cool support you have used for group builds.

The total time from start to finish should not exceed 45 minutes.

## Data collection & Anonymity

With your permission, we will audio record the interview session to support transcription. No other personally identifying information will be collected. In all written publications and presentations based on this research, you will remain anonymous -- your comments will be referred to with either a participant number or a pseudonym.

## Consent

Your participation is voluntary. You may refuse to answer specific questions as you see fit. You may withdraw from participation in this study at any time. Within thirty (30) days of your interview, if you choose, you may request to have your data withdrawn from the study.  

## Risks & Benefits

There is no cost to you to participate in this study. At the completion of the interview, you will receive a $10 Amazon gift card as remuneration for participation.
