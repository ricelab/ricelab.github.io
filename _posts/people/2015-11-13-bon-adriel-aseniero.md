I am currently an PhD student at the Interactions Lab [(iLab)](http://ilab.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/), University of Calgary. I am a member of the Innovations in Visualization Lab [(InnoVis)](http://innovis.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/), supervised by [Dr. Sheelagh Carpendale](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~sheelagh/wiki/pmwiki.php) and [Dr. Anthony Tang](http://hcitang.org/). My research topic is in the intersection of Information Visualization (InfoVis), Personal Informatics, and Human–Computer Interaction (HCI). I have also done research in augmented reality under [Dr. Ehud Sharlin](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~ehud/) in the past. I have received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science: Human–Computer Interaction, and a Master's degree in Computer Science: Information Visualization.

I create interactive visualizations, focusing on visualizing personally relevant data such as personal health and activities {% cite aseniero2014river %}, to engage people in personal health awareness {% cite huang2015pva aseniero2012deeppersonalization %}. This involves investigating how visualizations can be designed such that they are aesthetically pleasing, engaging, and easily accessible {% cite aseniero2015stratos ledo2013onespace ledo2013onespaceworkshop %}. My work often involves aspects of visual and interaction design, and qualitative data analysis, in addition to my computer science background. 

My hobbies are Drawing, Amateur Photography, Singing, Online Gaming, Filming & Video Editing, Graphic Design, & Blogging. I also have an interest in the Visual Arts, Fashion & Entertainment, Digital Devices, Robots, and Languages.
