I am an Associate Professor in the [Faculty of Information](http://ischool.utoronto.ca/) at the University of Toronto. I direct the RICELab (Rethinking Interaction, Collaboration and Engagement) research group.

My research interests are situated in Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) -- the study of how people work together using technology -- with a twist of Ubiquitous Computing -- technology in everyday scenarios. My current research investigates the integration of mobile devices in large display environments, exploration into personal informatics, and telecommunication technologies for collaborative work.

I am a proud member of the Extremely Tall and Extremely Short HCI Researchers Club. If you haven't met me, I am a very very tall guy. Really.
