Digital workrooms are places where teams will work and make decisions from in the future. We envision such rooms as being comprised of multiple large-scale interactive surfaces as well as personal devices such as mobile devices, tablets, and laptops. Our interest is to designing interaction techniques and applications for such environments that allow people to work effectively and fluidly with one another. Our intention is to build powerful tools that augment how teams think and operate. Our work in this space is long-running and multi-faceted.

**Foundational Studies of Collaborative Work.** We have conducted several foundational studies of the ways in which people work and operate with traditional surfaces (e.g. tabletops and whiteboards) in order to extract and understand design requirements for digital counterparts {% cite tang2009supporting tang2008fourlessons tang2006studying %}.

Here you see concept (left), conception (centre), and prototype (right).' %}

**Interaction Techniques.** We have also designed many different kinds of interaction techniques, including the now famous Rotate-N-Translate technique, which is a standard interaction technique on most touch surfaces {% cite kruger2005fluid %}, as well as full-body shadow-based interaction techniques {% cite shoemaker2007shadow %}, and we have explored designing gesture-based techniques for interaction in MSEs {% cite seyed2012eliciting %}.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/project-images/spalendar.jpg" caption='Spalendar is a spatially-aware calendar that makes of proxemic variables (distance, orientation, etc.) of a user for interaction. Above, we illustrate several interaction techniques implemented in this prototype.' %}

**Applications.** To ground our explorations, we have also designed several concrete applications. These applications range in terms of domain, and application scenario. For instance, {% cite finke2008lessons tang2008bystanderworkshop tang2008designing %} explore the design and use of publicly accessible displays in public settings, where we designed mobile phone-based interaction techniques for interacting with the public display. We have also studied specific application scenarios, including medical data exploration {% cite seyed2014medical seyed2014exploring %}, brainstorming scenarios with paper-based interaction {% cite pertender2012ideaplayground %}, teaching and learning scenarios where students use devices to interact with large projected displays {% cite lanir2010studentcontrol %}, awareness displays for colleagues {% cite chen2012spalendar %}, oil and gas exploration {% cite seyed2013skyhunter %}, and decision making support for software engineering {% cite aseniero2015stratos aseniero2014thesis %}.

{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/project-images/excite.jpg" caption='EXCITE allows us to study <em>how</em> people are collaborating within multi-surface environments, allowing us to track and make sense of their actions and activities.' %}

**Tools for Understanding MSE Use.** To support our studies of how people make use of these tools, we have designed several tools that allow us to visualize and understand _how_ people are making use of the tools, which in turn allows us to design more effective tools for collaboration in MSEs {% cite marquardt2015excite tang2010vistaco %}.
