Many soft tissue injuries are well-suited for physiotherapy intervention -- for instance, overuse of a shoulder, or tweaking a knee, etc. Our interest is in designing tools to support these interventions. In one exploration, we studied how to design tools for remote physiotherapy, where a client can "visit" and work with a physiotherapist via a remote video connection {% cite ledo2013onespace dillman2013remotephysiotherapy %}. This exploration present new challenges for conventional videochat applications, and we designed tools to overcome these challenges.

Nevertheless, we found such "visits" would still need to be augmented with at-home interventions that could support guidance on exercises, where people could be reminded of and guided to perform an exercise properly. We explored several visualization techniques for providing this feedback {% cite tang2015physioathome tang2014physioathome %}.
