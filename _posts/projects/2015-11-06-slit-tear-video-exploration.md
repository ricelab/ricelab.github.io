{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/project-images/slit-tears.jpg" caption='Slit-tears ease exploration of video data. Here: (1) the analyst draws to red slit tears in the video frame; (2) the timeline updates to show what happens under each tear for every frame in the video, while (3) the current frame shown is indicated by the red line.' %}

We explore the use of interactive slit-scanning for the purpose of video exploration. We show how such interactive slits (which we call slit-tears) allow for trivial identification of "interesting" events in video {% cite tang2008exploring tang2009exploring %}. This timeline is interactive, and allows for recovery of the original video frame. We argue that the slit-tear technique can be used to simplify computer vision techniques {% cite tang2008activityslittear %}, as the resulting visualizations are simple 2D representations of the original scene. That, and it's pretty wicked cool to look and play with.
