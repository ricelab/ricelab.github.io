Games are an important piece of the social fabric in our everyday lives. They help us build relationships with one another, and us with a fantasy space to practice working with and competing against others.

Although not a "core project" for RICELab, we have a continuing interest in games -- and I don't just mean in terms of playing them! -- both in terms of studying how people interact with one another in games {% cite tang2012verbal wong2009character neustaedter2010role %}, and in terms of designing engaging experiences {% cite jones2014spherosumo finke2008lessons neustaedter2013creating %}. Our explorations have included physical games {% cite jones2014spherosumo %}, MMORPGs {% cite wong2009character %}, first-person shooters {% cite tang2012verbal %}, and pervasive games {% cite neustaedter2010role neustaedter2013creating jeffrey2006chasing %}.

We are also explore how people use and appropriate livestreaming technologies for immersing themselves in others' activities and lives.
