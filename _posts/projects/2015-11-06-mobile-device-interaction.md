In (a) the mobile projector provides context, while in (b) it provides focus -- i.e. more detail. The projections and shared display automatically adjusts to the needed size and level of detail.' %}

Although the computing power in mobile devices now far exceeds that which sent man to the moon, the ways in which we interact with these devices is limited by their physical form factor. For instance, before touch screens became cheap and widespread, we were limited to a 12-digit entry on most phones. Today, many of our smallest devices (e.g. a FitBit or a worn sensor) lack meaningful screens for output and/or do not have a meaningful way to input information or data. In this project, we explore how we can extend the input and output capabilities of mobile devices by: leveraging on-board sensor capabilities in novel ways {% cite seyed2014exploring chen2012extending boring2012fatdemo boring2012fat %}, augmenting the output capabilities with in-world projection {% cite weigel2013projectorkit weigel2013focus %}, or by reconsidering how information is tagged in the world {% cite miyaoku2007cband miyaoku2007c %}. For instance, in the FatThumb work {% cite boring2012fatdemo boring2012fat %}, touch screen devices make use of contact size (e.g. using the tip of your thumb vs. your whole thumb) to reinterpret input.
