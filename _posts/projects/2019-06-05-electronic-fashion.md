{% include figure.html src="/assets/images/project-images/mannequette.png" caption='The mannequette is a prototyping platform for electronic fashion garments. It is used in different ways: (a) in-situ, iterating and deciding upon fabrics at a market; (b) for prototyping light (LED) patterns and sensors on a miniature dress form with fabrics by using the mixer; (c) for integrating a previously prototyped and now completed pattern and sensor interactions into an assembled garment; (d) in a completed garment created in a runway show.' %}

Digital tools enable rich new forms of self-expression, and we explore this in the context of electronic fashion.

To enable our work, we design new toolkits for building electronic fashion. This gives designers the ability to access electronic sensors and actuatuators without needing to write computer code {% cite seyed2019mannequette %}.

We are also interested in how these electronic garments can be used for communicating challenging concepts and ideas.
