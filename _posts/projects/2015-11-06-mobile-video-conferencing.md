Current video conferencing tools were designed with a "talking heads" metaphor -- that is, people sitting in an office or meeting room chatting with other people sitting in an office or meeting room. Yet, mobile devices and mobile networks are now capable of rich, high resolution and high fidelity experiences without the ned to be physically tethered to a desk. In this project, we have been involved in several lines of inquiry: what are new ways that people can have and share experiences in the world {% cite procyk2014sharedgeocaching procyk2014sharedgeocachingvideo %}, what are the basic challenges that mobile video conferencing presents to participants {% cite jones2015mobilecamerawork %}, and how can we design effective and enjoyable experiences for mobile video conferencing participants {% cite jones2015mobilevideoconferencing %}.

We are currently exploring how novel technologies can be designed to enable remote people to provide assistance for physical tasks. Our explorations have included novel interaction techniques for mobile devices, AR, and other techniques.
