In this series of works, we explore the role of large display and mobile technologies within the context of a university classroom. We explore how multiple displays can be used in ways that go beyond mirroring the display of the presenter {% cite lanir2008multipresenter %}, and how we can blur the lines between learners and instructors by challenging conventional notions of control across shared displays {% cite lanir2010studentcontrol %}. These designs are built from careful studies of how people make use of large displays {% cite tang2009supporting tang2006studying %}. A more recent design explored how sketching could be used as an input mechnism for a large display designed for teaching math {% cite grossauer2012mathsketch %} or for brainstorming {% cite perteneder2012ideaplayground %}.
