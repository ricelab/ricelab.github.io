David Fincher's 1997 classic [The Game](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119174/) tells the story of a live-action game that permeates a character's entire existence. This is the inspiration for our interest in pervasive games, which allow participants to play as a part of their everyday lives. [Geocaching](http://geocaching.com), a real-life scavenger hunting game, is perhaps the most successful of these kinds of games, allowing people to play as part of their daily routine {% cite neustaedter2010role %}.

In this project, we have achieved three major objectives. First, we have studied and analyzed the factors that make geocaching successful {% cite neustaedter2010role %}. Second, we have tried to design our own pervasive games in an attempt to replicate those successes {% cite neustaedter2013creating neustaedter2012mrgames jeffrey2006chasing %}. Finally, with ScienceCaching, we have married the fun, ad hoc nature of Geocaching with the meaningful tasks of citizen science {% cite dunlap2015sciencecaching dunlap2013thesis %}.
