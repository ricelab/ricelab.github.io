Mixed reality (AR/VR) will soon change how we interact other people and information, allowing us to interact across time and space. This project explores fundamental questions of how we can achieve those goals, and how mixed reality interfaces should be designed to enable these new forms of interaction.

Smaller subprojects have addressed the following questions:
* How do people expect to use gestures to interact with holograms {% cite pham2018hologestures %}?
* How can we help remote friends with physical tasks {% cite tang2017360videochat feick2018rema fakourfar2016annotations %}?
* How can we communicate with people who are not wearing HMDs?
* How can we use mixed reality to preserve making and maker activities?

We are interested in exploring the use of mixed reality to enable new forms of communication across distance (where people are remote from one another) and across time (pre-recorded for use in the future).
