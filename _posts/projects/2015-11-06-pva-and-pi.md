We are now awash in data about ourselves -- some of which we collect on our own (e.g. FitBit), others of which are collected by us on our behalf (e.g. [Google Location History](https://www.google.ca/maps/timeline?authuser=0)), and others we are barely aware of being collected (e.g. your energy bill). In this project, we are looking for new ways of collecting this information, exploring this information, and devising ways of understanding this information {% cite huang2015pva carpendale2014pvaworkshop %}. We have explored a variety of application spaces, including personal activity tracking {% cite aseniero2014river %}, physical visualizations {% cite payne2014physviz %}, and health applications {% cite rahman2014headaches macleod2013personal polleti2012ecobalance %}.

We are currently exploring new ways of visualizing this information in ways that address the specific and personal needs of users {% cite aseniero2012deeppersonalization %}, and for communication and interaction with health providers {% cite macleod2013towards macleod2013patientdata macleod2013personalinformatics %}. To do this, we have partnered with the [Calgary Headache Assessment & Management Program](http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/3672.asp), and are focusing on chronic headaches as a specific application space.
