It turns out that people tweet while they watch sports, and just looking at the 'hotspots' of activity tells us when something interesting happened!" %}

People tweet while watching sports. Some of this tweeting is of excitement, some of it is disappointment, and some of it is latent background information. In this work, we explore whether these tweets cn be leveraged to create video highlight reels of a sports match {% cite tang2012epicplay %}. The short answer: yes. The longer answer: mostly yes, if you don't mind getting a few false positives.
