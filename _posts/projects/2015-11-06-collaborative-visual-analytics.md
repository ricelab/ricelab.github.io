Many situations involve studying, exploring, and understanding data (and frequently communicating this understanding) with others. We envision digital workrooms that help support these processes. Our goal is to designi tools and interaction techniques that can support this interactive analytic process in such digital workrooms.

In this project, we have explored the fundamental mechanics of how people go about analyzing information and data {% cite isenberg2013data isenberg2008exploratory %}, particularly given rudimentary tools {% cite tang2006collaborative %}. We have imagined and explored next-generation interactive digital workrooms {% cite tang2011interstitial %}, and have built domain-specific tools to study how people analyze data with such tools {% cite aseniero2015stratos %}. Finally, we have built tools to study _how_ people are analyzing data, and making use of space and tools {% cite marquardt2015excite tang2010vistaco %}.
